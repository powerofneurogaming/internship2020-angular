                blurb: "Leanne is the Associate Director for the Research on Autism and Development Laboratory and also the Director of the Power of NeuroGaming (PoNG) Center at the University of California, San Diego. Her research scientist appointment lies in the Qualcomm Institute and the Institute for Neural Computation, allowing her to engage in interdisciplinary research with clinicians, engineers, and educators. Leanne seeks ways to use sensor-based technology to create closed-loop adaptive systems for intervention and assessments to evaluate intervention outcomes efficacy. Leanne and her close collaborator, Jeanne Townsend, Ph.D. (Neurosciences, UCSD) have designed and delivered a suite of gaze-contingent training games to improve spatial re-orientation of attention and gaze control of teens on the autism spectrum. This work led to the creation of the PoNG Center to develop and test sensor-enabled games targeted for different cognitive and motor skill assessment or improvement. This work also led to the creation of BrainLeap Technologies, a company that seeks to make the attention training games broadly available. Leanne also has over 10 years of experience in the science of learning through her participation in the NSF-funded Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center, and her use of innovative active learning methods honed while teaching at Minerva Schools. Most recently, her work with individuals on the autism spectrum led to an NSF-funded Future of Work program that supports the creation of a neurodiverse internship program and tools for moving people with socio-cognitive differences into work.  Her experiences in this internship have also changed how she teaches now incorporating team-based project work into her teaching at UC San Diego.\n\nLeanne earned her Ph.D. in Systems Neurobiology at NYU’s Center for Neural Science and prior to that her B.A. in Biological Basis of Behavior and Anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania.",

His current evaluation projects cover a wide range of topics, including health care, advanced manufacturing, STEM education, and the role of philanthropy in economic development. He has worked on a number of labor market and innovation reports, including a grant from the National Science Foundation on the role social and cultural dynamics play in regional economic development. Dr. Shapiro was one of the core evaluators on the effectiveness of the Department of Labor’s $500 million WIRED initiative, which involved 15 regions across the United States. He also leads Extension’s market research team, which focuses on assisting educational programs to conduct market research and curricula development for workforce and education training programs. Dr. Shapiro has taught classes on research methodology for UC San Diego and is trained in both qualitative and quantitative methodologies with a specialization in survey design. Recently, Dr. Shapiro created an Income Share Agreement program with UC San Diego Extension and the San Diego Workforce partnership to help local Opportunity Youth train for and obtain jobs in the tech-industry via certificates in areas like digital marketing and business analytics. The first cohort had 50 slots for about 500 applicants. Dr. Shapiro is also a Co-Investigator on the Future of Work project with Chukoskie, leading the evaluation team.\n\nBefore attending graduate school, Dr. Shapiro worked in the conflict resolution field in Washington D.C., served as a public school teacher in South Carolina, and built homes with Habitat for Humanity in Louisiana. Dr. Shapiro holds a Ph.D. and M.A. in sociology from the UC San Diego and a B.A. in social thought and analysis from Washington University in St. Louis.",

Calbright College is committed to increase economic mobility for working adults who lack easy access to traditional forms of higher education. Calbright is designed to offer flexible, affordable skills-based programs that provide tangible economic value for both working adults and hiring managers.\n\nBefore this, I served as Chief Learning Scientist at Minerva. I joined Minerva as Employee #1 in 2012, and spent the following six years developing and shipping new technologies to support learning and teaching. The initial versions of our Active Learning Forum, our multimodal tools for formative assessment, and our collaborative curriculum design system are a few past projects that came out of this work.\n\nPrior to Minerva, I was Chief Learning Architect at Grockit, where I helped develop the company's core social learning and assessment technologies, designed a system for educational data analysis and learning analytics, and led all research initiatives. In 2011, I developed Grockit Answers to enable productive peer-to-peer learning around educational videos.\n\nSince I first created it in 2010, I've been host of Studio Sketchpad, a website for creative coders to collaboratively author and share interactive animations written in Processing. In addition to serving as a venue for informal collaborative learning, Sketchpad has also been used in over 125 university courses, high school classes, and coding workshops around the world.\n\nI was awarded a PhD in Computer Science from Brandeis University in 2008. In my dissertation work, I examined the possibilities of motivating learning among peers by incorporating these interactions into a game. This drew on a combination of game theory, system design, and a statistical analysis of data from tens of thousands of kids practicing spelling online. Here's a tough one: accommodation."
